# 🧵 Muroden Client Management System (Excel VBA)
## Project Overview
This project features a custom-built Automated Client Management System developed for Muroden Tailoring Shop in Saudi Arabia. Built entirely using Excel VBA, the system replaces traditional manual record-keeping with a digitized database, streamlining the workflow for customer data entry and information retrieval.

## Objectives
- Digitize Records: Transition from paper-based logs to a structured Excel database.

- Automate Data Entry: Eliminate manual errors using a dedicated input interface.

- Advanced Searching: Provide instant access to client data through a multi-criteria search engine.

- Improve Efficiency: Support the management of thousands of records with zero database maintenance costs.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications): To program custom UserForms and backend logic.

- Microsoft Excel: As the core database and data storage engine.

- UserForms: For creating interactive, user-friendly graphical interfaces.

## System Features
- The system consists of two primary functional modules:

- Client Entry Form: A specialized interface to add new customer details (Name, Phone, Invoice Number, Book Number) directly into the Excel sheet. 

- Advanced Search Form: A powerful filtering tool that allows the user to search through thousands of records using different criteria like Phone Number, Client Name, or Invoice Number.

## Data Processing Steps
1. Database Architecture: Structured Excel sheets to act as tables for storing client information.

2. Form Development: Designed intuitive UserForms with input validation to ensure data integrity.

3. VBA Scripting: Wrote optimized code for adding records and executing high-speed searches across the dataset.

4. Interface Customization: Branded the system with the Muroden logo for a professional business look.

## Key Insights & Impact
- Operational Speed: Searching for a client now takes seconds instead of minutes of manual browsing.

- Data Accuracy: Automated entry reduces the risk of duplicate or incorrect records.

- Scalability: The system is designed to handle a growing database of thousands of rows without performance lag.

## How To Use This Project
- Download the .xlsm (Macro-Enabled) file.

- Open the file and Enable Macros when prompted by Excel.

- Click on the main buttons ("إدخال عملاء" or "بحث") to launch the interactive forms.

- Add data via the entry form or search for existing records using the search form.
